For the element with the anim id, the code snippet above sets 
the animation-name to colorful and sets the animation-duration
to 3 seconds. Then the @keyframes rule links to the animation
properties with the name colorful. It sets the color to blue at
the beginning of the animation (0%) which will transition to 
yellow by the end of the animation (100%). You aren't limited to
only beginning-end transitions, you can set properties for the
element for any percentage between 0% and 100%.

#anim {
  animation-name: colorful;
  animation-duration: 3s;
}

@keyframes colorful {
  0% {
    background-color: blue;
  }
  100% {
    background-color: yellow;
  }
}
