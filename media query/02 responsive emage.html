Making images responsive with CSS is actually very simple. You just need to add these properties to an image:

img {
  max-width: 100%;
  height: auto;
}



The simplest way to make your images properly appear on High-Resolution Displays, 
such as the MacBook Pros "retina display" is to define their width and height values 
as only half of what the original file is. Here is an example of an image that is only using half of the original height and width:

<style>
  img { height: 250px; width: 250px; }
</style>
<img src="coolPic500x500" alt="A most excellent picture">
